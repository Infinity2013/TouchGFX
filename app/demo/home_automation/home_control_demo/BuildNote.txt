Switch 800x480 / 640x480 mode:

The demo can be build for two resolutions (800x480 and 640x480). This is all handled in the gui\include\gui\common\Config.hpp file.

To change the settings for the simulator build simply modify this file (as instructed in the file).

When building for the supported targets you do not need to change anything. This is already handled in the Config.hpp file.


Build Optimizations:

The demo supports more than one demo board. These demo boards uses different
non opaque image formats for optimal performance. The generated images are
per default in the RGB565 format that is the optimal format for e.g. the
NXP boards. For optimal performance on the ST STM32F429 boards you need to 
change the settings in config/gcc/app.mk or config/msvs/Application.props to.

non_opaque_image_format := ARGB8888
text_data_format := A4

(see documentation (Application/Project Configuration) for further help)

and rebuild the simulator and then build and deploy to your target board.
