The demo supports more than one demo board. These demo boards uses different
non opaque image formats for optimal performance. The generated images are
per default in the ARGB8888 format that is the optimal format for ST boards.
For a slightly lower footprint and slightly increased performance on e.g. NXP
boards, change the settings in config/gcc/app.mk or config/msvs/Application.props to:

non_opaque_image_format := RGB565
text_data_format := 

(see documentation (Application/Project Configuration) for further help)

and rebuild the simulator and then build and deploy to your target board.
